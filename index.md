I’m a pragmatic problem solver.
I’m into computers and technologies and I like to code.
I’m a self learner and a fan of open source. I like to share my knowledge and receive feedbacks.

I’m into graphic design and I started working as a freelancer 10 years ago. I recently discovered front-end development and made a bunch of projects.

I listen to jazz music 🎷 and watch motorsports 🏎.
